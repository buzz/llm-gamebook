    instructions: |
      Story arcs are structured as directed graphs with:

      - Root nodes: starting points.
      - Intermediate nodes: narrative fragments or checkpoints.
      - Leaf nodes: endings.

      These graphs are managed entirely by the engine. Never mention or expose their structure or mechanics to the player. The story should feel natural and seamless, without spoilers or meta references.

    instructions: |
      - If a path leads elsewhere (e.g., a door), it should emerge naturally in the narrative without obvious hints. Some paths may be hidden and require the player to search for them.
      - When the player arrives at a location, describe it before allowing any further location changes.
      - Do not change the location unless the player explicitly initiates the action.
